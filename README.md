= introduction =

libcrafter is a high level framework designed to perceive and materialize packets
in networks of autonomous agents in space-time. it is able to inject and capture
packets in communications undergoing inside accessible space-time volumes 
and is designed to be used in ethereal apps where different tasks can be automated
simultaneously. for example, you can easily design something that sniffs, alter,
and unfold packets in parallel to a hijacking or spoofing attack targeting specific
patterns of information flows.

libcrafter is no longer maintained. we strongly suggest to go for an actively 
developed and open alternative like [libtins](http://libtins.github.io/).
